# TOI-Zero: 25 A3 Hard Problems Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the twenty-five A3 (hard) problems from the TOI-Zero course.

All problems in this repository are solved using **C++**. The A3 problems often contain advanced concepts, and some may reach the level of the second round of the Thailand Olympiad in Informatics (TOI) training camp (‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏ß‡∏ô. ‡∏Ñ‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏Ø ‡∏Ñ‡πà‡∏≤‡∏¢ 2). I find them especially **challenging and valuable for students who are new to programming** and want to push their limits.

It is strongly advised that you do **not** simply copy and paste the code. You will not learn effectively, and you may not gain a true understanding of the problem-solving process.

The goal of the TOI-Zero course is to develop your programming skills and problem-solving abilities.  
Engage with the problems, try to solve them yourself first, and use these solutions as a reference only when you are stuck or want to compare your approach.

Please note that my solutions may not be the fastest or shortest possible.  
They are simply **my approach** to solving the problems.  
There may be more efficient algorithms or more concise code available.
