This repository contains my solutions to the twenty-five A3 (hard) problems from the TOI-Zero course.

**Important Disclaimer:**

These solutions are provided for **educational purposes only**.  It is strongly advised that you do not simply copy and paste the code. You will not learn effectively, and you may not gain a true understanding of the problem-solving process.

**Learning is Key:**

The goal of the TOI-Zero course is to develop your programming skills and problem-solving abilities.  Engage with the problems, try to solve them yourself first, and use these solutions as a reference only when you are stuck or want to compare your approach.

**No Guarantees:**

Please note that my solutions may not be the fastest or shortest possible.  They are simply my approach to solving the problems.  There may be more efficient algorithms or more concise code available.
